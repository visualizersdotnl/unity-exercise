	Boggle solver implementation, written the weekend of December 9 & 10, 2017 by Niels J. de Wit (ndewit@gmail.com).
	Please take a minute to read this piece of text.

	Rules:
		- Only use the same word once.
		- Can't reuse a letter in the same word.
		- There's no 'Q', but there is 'Qu'.
		- Words must be at least 3 letters long.

	Scoring (original):
		- 3, 4 = 1
		- 5 = 2
		- 6 = 3
		- 7 = 5
		- >7 = 11

	"For the purposes of scoring Qu counts as two letters: squid would score twÂ§o points (for a five-letter word) despite being formed from a 
	chain of only four cubes."

	Rules and scoring taken from Wikipedia.

	Notes:
		- Compile with full optimization (-O3 for ex.) for best performance.
		- I could not assume anything about the test harness, so I did not; if you want debug output check debug_print().
		- If LoadDictionary() fails, the current dictionary will be empty and FindWords() will simply yield zero results.
		- All these functions can be called at any time from any thread as the single shared resource, the dictionary,
		  is guarded by a mutex and no globals are used.
		- If an invalid board is supplied (anything non-alphanumerical detected) the query is skipped, yielding zero results.
	
	I've done leak testing using Valgrind in OSX and I seem to be in the clear; there are some inconclusive and (hopefully) irrelevant
	ones reported in the runtime library, but you shouldn't run into killer pileups.

	About:
		This code style is influenced by my personal preference (today) and the scope of this project.
		As a professional, I like to adapt and feel it's in everyone interest to be consistent.

		I might have been a tad more verbose with my comments than usual ;)

		I've written this using the latest OSX, but it should compile out of the box on most platforms that adhere to
		the C++11 standard, including Linux and Windows.

		As for my approach: I wanted function, readability and portability. There are options worth considering that
		could improve performance, but for now I feel confident this is sufficient.
